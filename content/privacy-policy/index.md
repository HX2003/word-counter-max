### Last updated: 23 December 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Word Counter Max for Google Docs™ (“the Add-on”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use our Google Workspace add-on.

### Information We Access
The Add-on accesses only the content of the active document in order to provide its core functionality, such as generating word count statistics and related breakdowns.
- The document content is accessed temporarily and on-demand
- The content is not stored, logged, or transmitted to any external servers
- We do not collect personal information, document metadata, or user identifiers
- All document data remains within your Google account at all times.

### Authentication and Permissions
The Add-on uses Google OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and request the minimum permissions required to function.
- You never share your Google login credentials with us.
- Access is limited strictly to the scopes required for document analysis.
- We cannot access your data outside the permissions you explicitly grant.

### Data Sharing
- We do not sell, share, rent, or disclose your data to third parties.
- No document data or personal information is transmitted to external services.

### Security
We rely on Google’s secure infrastructure and OAuth framework to protect user data. Since no user data is stored or transmitted externally, the risk of data exposure is minimized.

### Third-Party Services
The Add-on operates entirely within the Google Workspace platform and complies with Google Workspace Marketplace policies.

Google Docs™ is a trademark of Google LLC. The Add-on is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the Add-on after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
