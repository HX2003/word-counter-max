## Why is it not working?
Check if you're using multiple accounts, in that case, you can log out of all accounts, and *only* log in with one account, or use incognito mode.

## Any tips?
If you're using the addon for long periods, you may want to check the slow update box to ensure that you don't hit the maximum quota though this should not be a problem in the latest version.

## What should I include to report a bug?
For error reporting, try to include screenshot of the F12 console menu, any error messages and a document to reproduce if necessary.
