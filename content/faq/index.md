## Why does the 'Extensions' tab not show up? I can't find the addon!
If the 'Extensions' tab does not show up, check if your file is .docx file, .docx files must be first saved as Google Docs™ files.

## Why is it not working?
Check if you're using multiple accounts, in that case, you can log out of all accounts, and *only* log in with one account, or use incognito mode.

## Any tips?
If you're using the add-on for long periods, you may want to check the slow update box to ensure that you don't hit the maximum quota though this should not be a problem in the latest version.

## What should I include to report a bug?
For error reporting, try to include screenshot of the F12 console menu, any error messages and a document to reproduce if necessary.
