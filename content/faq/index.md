## Why is it not working?
Check if you're using multiple accounts, in that case, you can log out of all accounts or use incognito mode. For Chrome users, problems may also arise if you are not using your primary account. Unfortunately, this is a problem on google's side and I can't directly fix it.

## Any tips?
If you're using the addon for long periods, you may want to check the slow update box to ensure that you don't hit the maximum quota though this should not be a problem in the latest version.

## What should I include to report a bug?
For error reporting, try to include console log, any error messages and a document to reproduce if necessary.
